    </h2>
    <p>Dharma is a Sanskrit term representing our unique alignment, values, harmony, and evolution, and it is central to my personal belief system. Everything in life strives to grow. When we fail to grow, we become stagnant, and both our mental and physical health begin to suffer. Falling out of alignment with our inner values causes us to lose sight of our "why"–  our driving force. As a result, our motivation wanes, and our challenges feel insurmountable. Distress, anxiety, depression, confusion, and uncertainty are all symptoms of a deeper misalignment that we subconsciously want to heal. Furthermore, I believe that when we examine these symptoms honestly, they reveal to us the ways in which we need to grow and find balance once again.</p>

    <p>All of our journeys involve suffering, some more so than others. When we become stuck in our suffering, it can cause us to act out of fear, and disconnect us from our inner wisdom. By integrating our negative experiences, we allow ourselves to learn from and accept them, allowing them to change us into more resilient versions of ourselves. I value the importance of facing our hardships, setbacks, and our wounds, and I offer a safe, supportive space to do that work, while gently guiding to new perspectives of understanding.</p>

    <p>I believe the world is what you make it, and that everyone has the ability and the right to feel empowered in their lives. When we are aligned with our Dharma, we understand how to grow; passion and excitement come easily, and we find the energy and motivation to accomplish our goals. Our challenges feel surmountable because they are uniquely ours– the ones that best support our growth and development.</p>

    <p>My approach involves understanding who we are at our deepest level, and identifying what it means to align with that authentic self. My goal is to empower clients to take on this journey and learn to do this work with confidence. Life is inherently challenging, and we feel victim to this challenge our suffering is deepened. By understanding our authentic selves and learning how to live in expression of that self, life's challenges become a joyful pursuit.</p>
