    <p>Currently pursuing my master’s in counselling, I am working towards becoming a Registered Clinical Counsellor (RCC). 
      My background includes a diploma in life coaching from Rhodes Wellness College, and my approach integrates elements of coaching 
      and counselling while remaining aligned with ethical guidelines. While I am not yet a licensed counsellor, I offer coaching services 
      rooted in evidence-based and holistic approaches to support those seeking clarity and change.</p>
    
    <p>With an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, I have long been fascinated by consciousness and the human experience. 
      My work is influenced by Jungian psychology, particularly the process of individuation and integrating the shadow. 
      I also draw upon practices from yoga, meditation, and Buddhist philosophy—techniques I have explored deeply in my own 
      life and found to be transformative.</p>
    
    <p>My personal journey has been profoundly shaped by the learning and application of these varying wisdoms. Having faced my own challenges, 
      I have radically shifted my perspective on life, discovering deeper meaning and resiliency in the process. I believe that overcoming my own 
      circumstances has given me unique insight and a deep capacity to empathize with others in their struggles. I am gifted in gently guiding people 
      toward more positive perspectives, helping them cultivate greater self-awareness, alignment, and personal growth.</p>
